# Big Mart sales data
Predicts the sales of individual products in the outlets of Big Mart. The data can be used to answer different questions. Two examples are given in the Jupyter notebooks:

- predict_full: This model predicts the sales of a new product that is introduced by Big Mart in the individual stores. The prediction is based on the properties of the different stores and of the items that are currently being sold.

- predict_single_store: Forecasts the sales in a new store that is about to open. The model uses the sales data in the outlets that already exist as features.
