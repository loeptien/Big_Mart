Big Mart sales data
Predicts the sales of individual products in the outlets of Big Mart. These predictions can be used to answer different questions, such as estimating the sales of a new product in the individual stores or forecasting the sales of the different products in a new store that is about to open.

This repository contains two Jupyiter notebooks:
- predict_full: This is the full model. It predicts the sales of each product in each store. The model is versatile and can be used to address different questions.

- predict_single_store: A more specialized model which predicts the sales in a new store that is about to open.
